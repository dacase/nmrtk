 
# NMRTK - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Tool Kit  

This is a set of C++, perl and shell scripts for calculating NMR quantities
such as residual dipolar couplings, and relaxation parameters (R1, R2, NOE)
in terms of ensemble structures from conformational search or molecular
dynamics simulation. Initially, NMRTK was developed loosely for three
projects with the corresponding publications as listed below:

1) Junchao Xia, Claudio J. Margulis, and David A. Case, "[Searching
and optimizing structure ensembles for complex flexible
sugars](http://doi.org/10.1021/ja205251j)," J. Am. Chem. Soc.(Communication)
133, 15252 (2011).

2) Junchao Xia, Nan-jie Deng, and Ronald M. Levy, "[NMR
relaxation in proteins with fast internal motions and slow
conformational exchange: model-free framework and Markov state
simulations](http://doi.org/10.1021/jp400797y)," J. Phys. Chem. B 117, 6625
(2013).

3) Jill J. Bouchard, Junchao Xia, David A. Case, and Jeffrey
W. Peng, "[Enhanced sampling of interdomain motion using
map-restrained langevin dynamics and NMR:  Application to Pin
1](http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00194)," J. Mol. Biol. 430, 2164
(2018).

# Installation Instructions

Currently NMRTK only supports Linux platform and requires installing a      
couple of C++ libs first. Please check `INSTALL.md` for more details on     
compiling and installation.                                                 

# Tutorial examples

The tutorial examples were included in `examples` folder. Please check
corresponding `README.md` files for more information.
